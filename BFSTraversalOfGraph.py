# Breadth First Search or BFS for a Graph
# Breadth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Breadth First Traversal of a tree 
# (See method 2 of this post). The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may
#  come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. 
#  For simplicity, it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex.
# For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2. When we come to vertex 0, we look for 
# all adjacent vertices of it. 2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0. If we donâ€™t mark visited vertices, then 2 will 
# be processed again and it will become a non-terminating process. A Breadth First Traversal of the following graph 
# is 2, 0, 3, 1.
