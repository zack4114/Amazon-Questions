# Difference between sums of odd level and even level nodes of a Binary Tree
# Given a a Binary Tree, find the difference between the sum of nodes at odd level and the sum of nodes at even level. 
# Consider root as level 1, left and right children of root as level 2 and so on.

# For example, in the following tree, sum of nodes at odd level is (5 + 1 + 4 + 8) which is 18. And sum of nodes at even 
# level is (2 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 9) which is 27. The output for following tree should be 18 â€“ 27 which is -9.

#       5
#     /   \
#    2     6
#  /  \     \  
# 1    4     8
#     /     / \ 
#    3     7   9  

# A straightforward method is to use level order traversal. In the traversal, check level of current node, if it is odd, 
# increment odd sum by data of current node, otherwise increment even sum. Finally return difference between odd sum and
#  even sum.
